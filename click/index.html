      Every time there’s a mass gathering of students, I’m super on edge, I’m looking for exits, I’m sitting in that front row, I’m monitoring those kids who I think are sort of suspicious. The fact that I can’t enjoy a homecoming rally because I’m worried about my gym getting shot up, that’s just the epitome of a really messed up gun culture.

      Gun training is not unimportant, but I think the best way to eliminate school shootings is to not have guns in schools. I’ve never been the biggest fan of hunting in the first place, but obviously since my high school was shot up, it soured me on hunting even more.

      I wish I didn't have to choose sides. My friends are totally against the police because they think cops are all out to get them. On the other hand, my cousin is a police officer and also a single mother of three. Not a single day goes by that I don't worry about her safety. I would never throw a rock at a cop, but I can see why someone else would.
